Create a blog iPhone app.

Make a model called Post that holds a title and body as string properties.

The first view should have a UITableView listing the title of all of the blog entries.
When you touch a UITableViewCell, it should push to another view that lets you edit the blog title, and content.
There should be an add (+) button that allows you to add a new blog post.
