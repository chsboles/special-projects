Write two classes in Ruby. One is a super class called `Vegetable`; the other is a child class that inherits from `Vegetable`.

Vegetable should have the following properties:
1. Have attributes for color, shape, and bites.
2. Initialize the vegetable to have 5 bites.
3. A boolean method called `salad?` that returns whether it should be used in a salad based upon the `dressing` parameter.
  - Return `true` if the dressing is Caesar.
  - Return `true` if the dressing is Ranch and the color is green (if defined).
  - Return `false` otherwise.
3. Define a boolean method that returns true if the object is a vegetable.
4. Define a bang method that removes a bite from the object.

The child class should be any vegetable. The properties should be set for that particular vegetable.
